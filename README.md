# GeolocationEngineering

The Geolocation-Engeneering Toolkit is to obtain the exact location of a user using an fake maps page through ngrok fowarding.

# Usage:
First Unzip ngrok:
```
unzip ngrok.zip
```

Then make tracker.sh executable and start the program with sudo privileges:
```sh
chmod +x tracker.sh

sudo ./tracker.sh
```

There will be 2 windows popping up:

| Function | Description |
