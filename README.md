# GeolocationEngineering

The Geolocation-Engeneering Toolkit is to obtain the exact location of a user using an fake maps page through ngrok fowarding.

# requirements:

xterm, apache2, unzip, php-curl

installation:
```
sudo apt install xterm
sudo apt install apache2
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt-get install php-curl
```
# Usage:
First unzip ngrok:
```
unzip ngrok.zip
```

Then make tracker.sh executable and start the program with sudo privileges:
```sh
chmod +x tracker.sh

sudo ./tracker.sh
```

There will be 2 windows popping up:
| Lifeview of logsfile | ngrok server status |

The coords shown are summarized under "Google Maps", 
you can see the geolocation on a map if you visit the printed url under this tag,

# IMPORTANT:
tracking will only work if you use the https secure web protocol 
(second link on ngrok), because geolocating is not allowed with the http protol, 
but it is with https






# ngrok

if you want to get an ngrok plan for unlimited server uptime, visit [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), sign up there, and

```sh
./ngrok authtoken YOURAUTHTOKEN

ngrok RESPONSE:

Authtoken saved to configuration file: /home/user/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
